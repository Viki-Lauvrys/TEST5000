### How to start?
    Run main.cpp

### Functionalities:
- [X] Game startup and initialization
- [X] Unique world generation
- [X] Player controls
- [X] 4 different types of platforms, each with their own properties
- [X] Player can interact with other objects
- [X] World view follows player (platforms and background scroll)
- [X] World becomes more difficult over time
- [X] Score system
- [X] Game over screen with score & restart option
